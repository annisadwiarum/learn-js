  Document Object Model (DOM) : is the heart of any kind of web page manipulation.
  when we created a something with browser when an HTML document loads inside it.
  we can created the code dom in console of browser with HTML structure..

  - the first, open console and write 'document'. then click enter. so yeah, u'll get the document structure there.
  - next, if you wanna using different properties and methods on this document object. write document dots "document." and than you can scrool through all of these different things right here.
  - ex: if u wanna to get the location of document. write "document.location" and then click enter.

  Dom, sees html as hierarchical tree of nodes and each one of these elements is considered a node in the dom.

  for DOM, html is the root of node.
